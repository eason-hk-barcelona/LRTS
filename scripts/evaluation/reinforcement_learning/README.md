# README

This folder contains implementation and evaluation scripts for reinforcement learning TCP. The implementation is adapted from https://bitbucket.org/HelgeS/retecs/src/master/. 
Run `extract_rl_data.py` to compute evaluation results for all RL TCP techniques defined in `../eval_const.py`, results will be saved to `rl_data/`.
